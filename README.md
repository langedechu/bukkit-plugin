# Bukkit Plugin (1.19.3)

This configuration is usable everywhere Maven and Java 17 are installed.

BTW, if your server uses Java 17, you really don't want to compile this plugin with a newer version. Trust me.

# Commands

- `basic` : Broadcasts `Hello, World` in the chat.

# Build

Just start the `build.cmd` (or `build.sh`) file from a terminal.

It will create a `target` folder, the compiled classes and the final JAR file will be in there.
